NEXT STEPS

1-> SHADOWS 
    Shadows force real workload, repeatedly drawing meshes 
    <- dir light DONE 
    <-multiple lights DONE 
    <- PCF 
    <- good bias 
    <- bug fixes with like, maybe clipping plane?
    <- Point light 
    <- Spot Light 
2-> BETTER SCENES 
    Probably loading from gltf, maybe USD, to render whole environments 
3-> COMPUTE 
    Culling and perf improvements for the new workload 
4-> (~ish) At some point, we should clean up the interfacs between scene, renderer, etc, and use handles rather than ptrs

FUN STUFF:

Polish /refactor painful areas
What's bad?
1- Descriptor sets still -- too much distant action, need to unify the setup and ingestion part 
2- Shaders 
    a- include modified  
    b- 
3- Object updates 
    Don't belong where thye are right now 
4- Basic structure of application
    Main shou;dn't be renderer
